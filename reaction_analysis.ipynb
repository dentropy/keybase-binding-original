      "Hello all. I am a entomologist (insect biologist) and also an organizer for this hackathon. I have been learning about Complexity since attending a summer school at Santa Fe Institute in 2015 (where I met @jpg505), and co-organizing the Stanford Complexity Group up till 2019 (where I met @drproton). I also like topics such as arts + crafts, improv, and computers. Looking forward to meeting & working with you all!\n",

      "My name is Gena from London. Super new to complexity science, but curious and keen to learn.  I identify as a platonist and aim to focus my energy to \"the true\", \"the good\" and \"the beautiful\". Understanding the nature of reality and helping perpetuate the above triad with every decision I take can be undeniably challenging. Often intent guides actions, and I used to think that constant and conscious alignment with the intent is bound to derive the desired manifestation. However, our world is complex, and often the right intent isn't sufficient - our actions, although well intended, have unintended consequences and externalities, and the incentives society, business and culture project upon us often derive undesired results.  This realisation has guided me towards learning more about systems thinking (took a course over the summer) and this pull to better understand and solve for complexity has landed me to Complexity Weekend. From an education perspective - I have a BS in Computer Science, but not the temperament for it, so escaped the field via an MBA in Innovation. Currently taking a Business Sustainability Leadership course at University of Cambridge. My love for storytelling, creative thinking/problem solving and rebelling against tradition/conditioning has landed me a job at Adobe as an Innovation Designer.  My favourite hobbies in 2020: better understanding the mind and the nature of reality, and painting visionary art (acrylic). Look forward to this weekend :)\n",
